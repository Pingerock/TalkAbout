# TalkAbout

My old project when I was trying to learn WPF by creating a copy of Twitter.

In this program you can sign in/sign up, send a post, like it and make a comment. You can also subscribe to other users.

The program works only with a database that's locally installed on your computer. The database file contains in "DataBase" folder. I used MS SQL Server Management Studio 18.

In this project I used this addons:
  - EntityFramework, version="6.4.4"
  - Extended.Wpf.Toolkit, version="4.1.0" 
  - MaterialDesignColors, version="2.0.1" 
  - MaterialDesignThemes, version="4.1.0" 
  
This project is unfinished and has bugs. Also I'm too lazy to translate all interface from Russian to English.
